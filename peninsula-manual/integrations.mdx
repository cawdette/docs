| **Custom development** | Full integration with proprietary systems | 2-4 weeks |

---

## Connection Model

All integrations follow a consistent connection and governance model.

### Authentication

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **OAuth 2.0** | Standard for cloud services (Microsoft, Google, Salesforce) |
| **API Keys** | Service account access for server-to-server connections |
| **SSO/SAML** | Enterprise identity provider integration |
| **Certificate-based** | Mutual TLS for high-security connections |

### Data Residency

Peninsula respects data residency requirements:

- **Region selection**: Choose where your data is processed and stored
- **In-transit encryption**: All data encrypted during transfer (TLS 1.3)
- **At-rest encryption**: AES-256 encryption for stored data
- **No cross-region transfer**: Data stays in designated regions unless explicitly configured

## Connector Configuration

Each connector requires specific configuration during setup.

**Standard configuration fields:**

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `connection_name` | Human-readable identifier for the integration |
| `auth_method` | Authentication type (OAuth, API key, etc.) |
| `scope` | What data to sync (folders, matters, date ranges) |
| `sync_schedule` | How often to check for updates |
| `permission_mapping` | How source permissions map to Peninsula ACLs |

**Example connector configuration:**

```json
{
  "connector": "microsoft_onedrive",
  "connection_name": "EBLG OneDrive",
  "auth_method": "oauth2",
  "scope": {
    "folders": ["/Legal/Matters", "/Legal/Templates"],
    "file_types": ["docx", "xlsx", "pdf"],
    "modified_after": "2020-01-01"
  },
  "sync_schedule": "hourly",
  "permission_mapping": "inherit_source"
}
```

---

## Integration Governance

All integrations are subject to governance controls.

**Pre-connection requirements:**
- Data owner approval for each source system
- Scope definition (what data, what access level)
- Permission mapping review
- Security assessment for new connector types

**Ongoing governance:**
- Sync health monitoring and alerting
- Access audit logs for all connector activity
- Quarterly connector review and scope validation
- Incident response procedures for sync failures

## Connector Status

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **Generally Available** | Production-ready, fully supported |
| **Beta** | Functional but may have limitations |
| **In Development** | Coming soon, available for early access |
