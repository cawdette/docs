## Overview

This glossary provides definitions for key terms, concepts, and acronyms used throughout the Peninsula documentation. Use this page as a quick reference when encountering unfamiliar terminology.

---

## Kelso

Kelso is Peninsula's AI agent layer. Unlike a simple chatbot, Kelso is a persistent worker with tools, memory, and task execution logic. Kelso can:

- Answer natural language questions about ESOP matters grounded in ERISA, IRC, and DOL regulations
- Edit files including spreadsheets, documents, CSVs, and PDFs
- Execute custom workflows with human review checkpoints
- Provide citations and source references for all substantive outputs

Kelso is designed to perform work, not just answer questions.

## Data Pool

The Data Pool is the collection of source systems and data stores that Peninsula ingests from. For a typical legal firm, this includes:

- Document management systems and matter repositories
- Email archives and correspondence
- Shared drives and cloud storage
- Meeting transcripts and call notes
- Structured exports from CRM, accounting, and workflow systems
- External legal reference sources (where licensed)

The Data Pool represents the raw input before processing and indexing.

---

## Overlay

An Overlay is a client-specific configuration layer that sits on top of Peninsula's standard operating model. Each client implementation has its own overlay that captures:

- Scope policies (what data is in/out of scope)
- Confidentiality tiers and access rules
- Workflow configurations and approval gates
- Taxonomy customizations
- Open decisions and client-specific FAQs

The EBLG Profile is an example of a client overlay.

---

## Indexing

Indexing is the process of creating retrieval structures that make future queries fast, relevant, and source-grounded. Peninsula uses hybrid indexing:

| Index Type | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Lexical index | Exact and near-exact keyword matching for precise legal terms and citations |
| Vector index | Semantic similarity and concept-level retrieval for related ideas |
| Metadata index | Filters by matter, client, date, confidentiality tier, and document type |

Indexing transforms raw data into searchable knowledge.

---

## Grounding

Grounding is the practice of anchoring AI outputs to specific source documents and evidence. In Peninsula:

- Every substantive output includes citations to source materials
- Retrieval happens before generation, not after
- The AI cannot fabricate information that isn't in the indexed corpus
- Human reviewers can trace any claim back to its origin

Grounding is the primary mechanism for reducing hallucinations and ensuring defensibility.

---

## Knowledge Graph

The Knowledge Graph is Peninsula's structured representation of relationships between legal concepts, matters, precedents, and documents. It connects:

- Practice domains and matter types
- Legal authorities (IRC sections, ERISA provisions, DOL guidance)
- Document classes and workflow types
- Jurisdictions and confidentiality classifications

The Knowledge Graph enables Peninsula to understand context and relationships, not just keywords.

---

## Retrieval Ranking

Retrieval Ranking is the process of ordering search results by relevance before presenting them to the AI or user. Peninsula's ranking considers:

- Query-document similarity (lexical and semantic)
- Source authority and reliability
- Recency and version status
- Access permissions and confidentiality fit
- Historical query patterns and feedback

Better ranking means more relevant context for AI synthesis.

---

## Work Product

Work Product refers to the deliverables Peninsula helps create. Examples include:

- Legal memos and opinion letters
- Due diligence summaries
- Transaction analyses and charts
- Research compilations with citations
- Regulatory compliance checklists

All work product requires human review before client delivery.

---

## Workflow Modules

Workflow Modules are repeatable, structured processes that Kelso can execute. Each module defines:

- Input requirements and data contracts
- Processing steps and decision logic
- Output schemas and formatting rules
- Citation requirements
- Human review checkpoints
- Escalation rules for edge cases

Modules turn ad-hoc tasks into consistent, auditable processes.

---

## Workspaces

Workspaces are organized environments within Peninsula where teams collaborate on specific matters or projects. A workspace provides:

- Scoped access to relevant documents and data
- Shared conversation history and context
- Matter-specific configurations and permissions
- Audit trails for all activity

Workspaces keep work organized and access controlled.

## Additional Terms

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="ACL (Access Control List)">
    A list of permissions attached to a document or resource that specifies which users or roles can access it and what operations they can perform.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Citation Readiness">
    A flag indicating whether a document has been processed to a level where it can be reliably cited in work product outputs.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Extraction Quality Score">
    A numeric measure (0-1) of how successfully text and structure were extracted from a source document during processing.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Knowledge Card">
    A structured record representing a single indexed document with all its metadata, taxonomy tags, and retrieval attributes.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="OCR (Optical Character Recognition)">
    Technology that converts scanned images or PDFs into searchable text. Peninsula applies OCR selectively based on extraction quality thresholds.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Processing Depth">
    The level of analysis applied to a document: L0 (metadata only), L1 (standard extraction), L2 (selective OCR), L3 (full enrichment with entity/relation tagging).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Provenance">
    The documented origin and history of a piece of data, including its source system, transformations, and lineage.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)">
    An AI architecture pattern where relevant documents are retrieved first, then used as context for generating responses. Peninsula uses RAG to ground all outputs.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Taxonomy">
