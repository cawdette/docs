## Why This Exists

Kevin requested a direct comparison between Microsoft-oriented AI policy recommendations and Peninsula implementation choices.

This page is the decision record: where we align, where we adapt, and why.

## Checklist

| Guidance theme | Peninsula position | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avoid black-box architecture | Use inspectable ingestion, retrieval, and audit layers | Aligned | Manual includes inspection protocol and evidence pack |
| Minimize manual tagging burden | Use hybrid approach: lightweight historical baseline plus forward incremental indexing | Adapted | Avoids full retro-tagging while preserving historical retrieval value |
| Use retrieval-grounded generation | Use hybrid retrieval with citation requirements | Aligned | Provenance is mandatory for substantive outputs |
| Protect confidential legal data | Apply role and matter-level access controls before retrieval | Aligned | Access controls are enforced pre-context assembly |
| Do not rebuild core PM systems | Keep Peninsula as knowledge layer over systems of record | Aligned | Explicit non-goal in manual and EBLG profile |
| Maintain portability and exit options | Maintain exports for data, lineage, and logs | Aligned | Quarterly portability drill in operating cadence |
| Require human oversight | Human review required for client-facing legal outputs | Aligned | Review gates in workflow policy |

## Decision Note: Retro-Indexing Question

The practical answer to "Do we retro-index everything?" is no.

Recommended policy:

- Build a high-value historical baseline.
- Index new approved content continuously.
- Backfill selectively when query analytics show misses.

This is the lowest-risk path to quality without forcing long-term manual tagging overhead.

## Evidence Required for Signoff

For each checklist row above, maintain:

- policy reference (manual section),
- implementation artifact (config, connector, or control),
- validation result (pass/fail/exception),
- owner and review date.

## Review Cadence

- Monthly: checklist status review with operations and IT.
- Quarterly: governance review with leadership and board-facing summary update.
