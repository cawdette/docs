## Overview

Peninsula leverages a multi-model architecture to deliver intelligent capabilities across different use cases. Rather than relying on a single AI model, Peninsula routes tasks to the model best suited for each job, ensuring optimal performance, cost efficiency, and output quality.

---

## Multi-Model Architecture

Peninsula's intelligence layer is model-agnostic by design. This provides:

## Primary Models

### Claude (Anthropic)

Claude serves as the primary model for deep reasoning and complex legal analysis.

| Strength | Application |
| --- | --- |
| **Long-context reasoning** | Analyzing lengthy documents and synthesizing across sources |
| **Nuanced interpretation** | Understanding legal language and regulatory nuance |
| **Citation accuracy** | Maintaining precise references to source materials |
| **Instruction following** | Adhering to firm style guides and output formats |

**Best for:**
- Legal memo drafting and opinion letters
- Complex regulatory analysis (ERISA, IRC, DOL)
- Multi-document synthesis and comparison
- Nuanced question answering requiring judgment

---

### GPT-4o (OpenAI)

GPT-4o excels at structured outputs and rapid processing.

| Strength | Application |
| --- | --- |
| **Structured generation** | JSON, tables, and formatted outputs |
| **Speed** | Fast responses for interactive workflows |
| **Tool use** | Reliable function calling and API integration |
| **Broad knowledge** | General business and technical tasks |

**Best for:**
- Data extraction and structuring
- Spreadsheet and CSV manipulation
- Quick lookups and fact retrieval
- Workflow automation steps

---

### Gemini (Google)

Gemini provides multimodal capabilities for documents with mixed content.

| Strength | Application |
| --- | --- |
| **Multimodal processing** | Documents with images, charts, and diagrams |
| **Large context** | Very long documents in a single pass |
| **Visual understanding** | Interpreting tables, flowcharts, and signatures |

**Best for:**
- Processing scanned documents with visual elements
- Analyzing presentations and reports with charts
- Documents where layout and visual structure matter

## Model Selection Logic

Peninsula automatically routes tasks based on multiple factors:

### Routing Criteria

| Factor | Consideration |
| --- | --- |
| **Task complexity** | Simple extraction vs. complex reasoning |
| **Output format** | Prose vs. structured data |
| **Context length** | Short query vs. multi-document analysis |
| **Content type** | Text-only vs. multimodal |
| **Latency requirements** | Interactive vs. batch processing |
| **Cost sensitivity** | High-value vs. routine tasks |

### Routing Examples

| Task | Routed To | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Draft ESOP opinion letter | Claude | Complex legal reasoning, long-form output |
| Extract data from spreadsheet | GPT-4o | Structured output, tool use |
| Analyze scanned plan document | Gemini | Multimodal, visual table extraction |
| Classify 500 documents | Deepseek | Bulk processing, cost efficiency |
| Quick fact lookup | GPT-4o | Speed, simple retrieval |

---

## Performance Characteristics

### Response Quality

All models are evaluated against Peninsula's quality benchmarks:

- **Citation accuracy**: Sources correctly identified and referenced
- **Factual grounding**: Claims supported by retrieved evidence
- **Format compliance**: Outputs match requested structure
- **Completeness**: All requested elements addressed

### Latency Profiles

| Model | Typical Latency | Best For |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GPT-4o | 1-3 seconds | Interactive chat, quick tasks |
| Claude | 3-10 seconds | Complex analysis, long outputs |
| Gemini | 2-5 seconds | Multimodal processing |
| Mistral | 1-3 seconds | Structured tasks, EU hosting |

## Governance of Model Outputs

Regardless of which model generates output, Peninsula applies consistent governance:

### Pre-Generation Controls

- Retrieval grounding required before generation
- Context assembly respects access controls
- Prompt templates enforce firm policies

### Post-Generation Controls

- Citation verification against source documents
- Confidence scoring for output reliability
- Hallucination detection and flagging
- Human review gates for client-facing work

### Audit Trail

Every model interaction is logged with:
- Model used and version
- Input context (with source references)
- Output generated
- Confidence scores
- User and timestamp

---

## Model Configuration

Clients can configure model behavior at multiple levels:

### Workspace-Level Settings

```json
{
  "default_model": "claude",
  "fallback_model": "gpt-4o",
  "max_tokens": 4096,
  "temperature": 0.3,
  "require_citations": true
}
```

### Task-Level Overrides

Users can request specific models for particular tasks when needed, subject to policy constraints.

### Policy Constraints

Administrators can set policies such as:
- Restrict certain models for confidential matters
- Require specific models for regulated workflows
- Set cost limits per workspace or user
