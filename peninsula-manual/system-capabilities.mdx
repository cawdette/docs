## Overview

Peninsula provides a comprehensive set of capabilities designed to support knowledge work at scale. This page outlines the core functional areas of the platform and what each enables for your team.

---

## Workspaces

Workspaces are organized environments where teams collaborate on specific matters, projects, or practice areas.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Matter-Scoped Access" icon="folder-open">
    Each workspace limits visibility to relevant documents and data based on matter and role permissions.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Shared Context" icon="users">
    Team members share conversation history, research threads, and work-in-progress within a workspace.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Configuration Control" icon="sliders">
    Workspace-level settings control which integrations, workflows, and AI behaviors are available.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Activity Audit" icon="clock-rotate-left">
    All workspace activity is logged for compliance, review, and continuous improvement.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

**Use cases:**

- Dedicated workspace per active matter or client engagement
- Practice area workspaces for shared precedent research
- Project workspaces for cross-functional initiatives

## Messaging & Collaboration

Peninsula provides natural language interaction with Kelso and structured collaboration features for teams.

| Feature                | Description                                                             |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Natural language chat  | Ask questions, request analysis, or initiate workflows in plain English |
| Threaded conversations | Maintain context across multi-turn interactions                         |
| @mentions and handoffs | Tag team members or escalate to senior review                           |
| Inline citations       | Every substantive response includes source references                   |
| Conversation export    | Export threads for documentation or compliance records                  |

**ESOP-specific examples:**

- "What are the repurchase obligation requirements for this plan?"
- "Summarize the DOL guidance on fiduciary standards for ESOP trustees"
- "Draft a memo on the IRC 409(p) anti-abuse rules"

---

## Document Generation

Peninsula accelerates the creation of legal work product with AI-assisted drafting grounded in your firm's knowledge.

**Supported outputs:**

- Legal memos and opinion letters
- Due diligence summaries and issue spotting reports
- Transaction analyses and comparison charts
- Client correspondence and advisory letters
- Regulatory compliance checklists

**How it works:**

1. User initiates a drafting request with context and requirements
2. Kelso retrieves relevant precedents, authorities, and firm templates
3. AI generates a first draft with inline citations
4. Human reviewer edits, approves, or requests revisions
5. Final document is produced with full audit trail

<Note>
  All generated documents require human review before client delivery. Peninsula does not auto-publish legal work product.
</Note>

## File Editing

Kelso can directly edit files across multiple formats, enabling hands-on document work without switching tools.

**Supported file types:**

| Format                   | Capabilities                                                     |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Spreadsheets (XLSX, CSV) | Update cells, add formulas, restructure data, generate summaries |
| Documents (DOCX)         | Edit text, apply formatting, insert sections, update tables      |
| PDFs                     | Extract content, annotate, convert to editable formats           |
| Text files               | Direct editing, formatting, and transformation                   |

**Example workflows:**

- Update a repurchase obligation spreadsheet with new participant data
- Revise a plan document section based on regulatory changes
- Extract key terms from a PDF agreement into a structured summary

| Metadata filtering     | Filter by matter, client, date, document type, confidentiality tier |
| Cross-system search    | Query across all connected source systems in one interface          |
| Relevance ranking      | Results ordered by authority, recency, and query fit                |
