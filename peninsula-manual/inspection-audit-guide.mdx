## Why This Page Exists

This is the operating answer to Kevin's core requirement: Peninsula must be understandable under scrutiny, not treated as a black box.

Use this page as the inspection protocol for leadership, IT, compliance, and future diligence reviews.

## Inspection Questions We Must Always Answer

1. What data entered the system, from where, and under what scope policy?
2. What data was excluded or put on hold, and why?
3. Which index entries and retrieval steps were used for an output?
4. Which user or agent executed the action?
5. What permissions were enforced at decision time?
6. What can be exported today if the firm needs portability?

## Required Evidence Pack

## Audit Trail Minimum Schema

Every production workflow should emit at least these fields:

| Field | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `event_id` | Immutable event identity |
| `timestamp_utc` | Sequencing and legal traceability |
| `actor_type` | Distinguish user, agent, or system |
| `actor_id` | Who initiated action |
| `matter_id` | Matter-scoped governance |
| `source_object_ids` | Provenance linkage |
| `retrieval_run_id` | Reconstruct evidence path |
| `permission_result` | Allowed/denied with policy reference |
| `output_id` | Trace generated artifacts |
| `review_status` | Human review and signoff status |

## Monthly Inspection Routine

1. Verify source inventory drift and unauthorized source additions.
2. Sample 20 outputs and confirm citation provenance integrity.
3. Review denied-access events for policy gaps.
4. Review hallucination incidents and remediation actions.
5. Run export drill on a sample matter to confirm portability.

## Escalation Triggers

Escalate to governance review when any of the following occur:

- Access boundary violation or suspected leakage.
- Citation provenance cannot be reconstructed.
- Hallucination incident in client-facing deliverable.
- Missing logs for workflow actions.
- Export package fails completeness checks.

## Non-Negotiable Outcome

Peninsula is only considered healthy when inspection data is available, reproducible, and understandable by a non-engineer legal operator.
