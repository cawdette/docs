## Overview

Peninsula is built with enterprise security requirements at its core. This page documents the security architecture, compliance certifications, and data handling policies that protect client information.

---

## Compliance Certifications

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="SOC 2 Type II Certified" icon="shield-check">
    Independent audit verification of security, availability, and confidentiality controls
  </Card>
  <Card title="Annual Penetration Testing" icon="bug">
    Third-party security assessments with remediation tracking
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

**SOC 2 Trust Service Criteria covered:**
- Security: Protection against unauthorized access
- Availability: System uptime and reliability commitments
- Confidentiality: Protection of confidential information
- Processing Integrity: Accurate and complete data processing

---

## Encryption Standards

All data is encrypted in transit and at rest using industry-standard protocols.

| Layer | Standard | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **In Transit** | TLS 1.3 | All API calls, data transfers, and user sessions |
| **At Rest** | AES-256 | All stored data, indexes, and backups |
| **Key Management** | HSM-backed | Hardware security modules for key storage |
| **Database** | Transparent encryption | Column-level encryption for sensitive fields |

**Certificate management:**
- Automated certificate rotation
- Certificate transparency logging
- HSTS enforcement on all endpoints

---

## Zero Data Retention Policy

Peninsula operates with a zero data retention policy for AI model interactions.

<Note>
Your data is never used to train AI models. Prompts and responses are not retained by model providers.
</Note>

**What this means:**
- Queries sent to AI models are not stored by the model provider
- No training on your firm's data or conversations
- Session data is ephemeral and cleared after processing
- You maintain full ownership and control of your data

**Data lifecycle:**

| Stage | Retention | Control |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Source data | Per your policy | You control retention in source systems |
| Indexed data | Per your policy | Configurable retention and deletion |
| AI interactions | Zero retention | Not stored by model providers |
| Audit logs | Configurable | Typically 1-7 years per compliance needs |

## Access Controls & RBAC

Peninsula enforces role-based access control (RBAC) at every layer.

### Permission Model

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Role-Based Access" icon="user-shield">
    Permissions assigned by role, not individual user
  </Card>
  <Card title="Matter-Level Restrictions" icon="folder-closed">
    Data access scoped to specific matters and clients
  </Card>
  <Card title="Least Privilege" icon="lock">
    Users receive minimum permissions needed for their role
  </Card>
  <Card title="Inheritance Controls" icon="sitemap">
    Permissions flow from source systems with override capability
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Standard Roles

| Role | Access Level | Typical Users |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Viewer** | Read-only access to assigned matters | Support staff, reviewers |
| **Contributor** | Read/write within assigned matters | Associates, paralegals |
| **Manager** | Full access plus team management | Partners, practice leads |
| **Admin** | System configuration and user management | IT administrators |

### Access Enforcement

- Permissions checked before every retrieval operation
- ACLs propagated from source systems
- Real-time permission updates (no caching delays)
- Audit logging of all access attempts

---

## Authentication

Peninsula supports enterprise authentication standards.

### SSO & Identity Providers

| Provider | Protocol | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Microsoft Entra ID** | SAML 2.0, OIDC | Supported |
| **Okta** | SAML 2.0, OIDC | Supported |
| **Google Workspace** | OIDC | Supported |
| **OneLogin** | SAML 2.0 | Supported |
| **Custom SAML** | SAML 2.0 | Supported |

### Multi-Factor Authentication

MFA is required for all users and supports:
- Authenticator apps (TOTP)
- Hardware security keys (FIDO2/WebAuthn)
- Push notifications
- SMS backup (configurable)

### Session Management

- Configurable session timeouts
- Automatic logout on inactivity
- Concurrent session limits
- Session revocation on password change
