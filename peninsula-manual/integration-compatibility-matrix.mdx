title: "Legal ERP Compatability"
description: "Compatibility view for Clarra/NetDocuments, Clio, Smokeball, Caret Legal, and MyCase."

## Purpose

This matrix translates Erica's shortlisted platforms into integration decisions with clear go/no-go checks.

Compatibility is defined by three requirements:

1. Documents are accessible through API or practical export.
2. Matter/client metadata can be mapped reliably.
3. Permissions can be enforced in Peninsula retrieval flows.

## Matrix (Initial)

| Platform | Typical integration path | Initial status | Key validation checks |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Clarra (with NetDocuments) | NetDocuments API/export plus matter mapping | Likely compatible | Confirm canonical storage location and ACL mapping model |
| Clio | Clio API for matters, contacts, and documents | Likely compatible | Confirm document access scope, rate limits, and metadata completeness |
| Smokeball | Vendor API or bulk export adapter | Partial, needs validation | Confirm API maturity and export path for production ingestion |
| Caret Legal | Vendor API or export adapter | Unknown, validate | Confirm available endpoints, auth model, and data shape |
| MyCase | MyCase API or structured export | Likely compatible | Confirm document linkage to matters and permission semantics |

## Required Data Contract Per Connector

Each connector must provide:

- Stable source object ID (`source_object_id`)
- Matter and client references (`matter_id`, `client_id`)
- File attributes (`file_type`, `created_at`, `updated_at`)
- Access attributes or policy pointers
- Linkage to source system for provenance

## Decision Rubric

Use this rubric before approving a connector:

| Criterion | Pass condition |
| --- | --- |
| Access | Programmatic read path exists (API/export) |
| Metadata | Matter/client mapping is deterministic |
| Security | Permissions can be enforced pre-retrieval |
| Portability | Source and derived records can be exported |
| Reliability | Connector supports repeatable incremental sync |

## Recommendation for EBLG Phase 1

Prioritize connectors in this order:

1. Clarra/NetDocuments
2. Clio
3. MyCase
4. Smokeball
5. Caret Legal

This sequence maximizes early delivery probability while reducing adapter risk in the first production cycle.
